### PBL Unit 1 / Week 0


- Monday: My partner and myself had our live review today. We practiced for our presentation before we delivered it, and then presented our hard work, for a score of 1.9/2.0 (95%). After we finished our live review, we started to read the Jupyter notebook section about python, and learning more python. We found out that we have a live review by the end of this week.
- Tuesday: On tuesday, my partner and I started our work on the notebook. We re-cloned the repository, since there had been some changes made on the teacher repo, so we must re-clone it and move over all my changes onto the newly cloned repo. I started editing the Compsci tab, and cleaning up the other tabs of my website, to make it more organized.
- Wednesday: On wednesday, I moved over many elements from my Blogs tab into my Compsci tab, since that's where they belonged. However, while I was working on all this set up, my deployed github website wasn't working at all. I unpublished my public site, and re-deploed, and made sure that all my changes were pushed. It took me a few hours to fix the error, and I encoded a calculator under the hacks tab of Compsci.
- Thursday: Thursday was a super productive day, since I made a lot of changes to my website, in order to make sure that it's prepared for the second Live Review that I have scheduled for tommorow. I made a quiz, added all ym hacks, edited the plans page, and added tables for all the terms that I learned that week. I also organized the Compsci tab, making final refiments, in order to ensure I'm ready for the assignment tommorow.
- Friday: Live Review Today
