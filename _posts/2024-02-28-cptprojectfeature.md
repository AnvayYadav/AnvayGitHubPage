### Project Ideation
Our project is like Indeed in the sense that it connects employers and freelancers. Employers can post jobs and applicants can apply to those jobs. The goal of our project is to fit the needs of employers when finding applicants and help applicants find jobs. We make communication between employers and freelancers easy. We contain a vast variety page ranging from a user review feature to a job posting feature.

### Ideas/Feedback

- Some  ideas I gained was to add a search based on the salary of the job. I also believe that a geolocation system would be a very cool and interactive idea
- Mr. Lopez's advice for our project is to add a profiling system to our Jobly where employers can see which users applied to their job
- In addition to this, Mr. Lopez suggested that we alert freelancers that have applied if they were accepted for the job. We are going to use this feedback to create a profiling system and make our website more applicable to the real world
- Lastly I think it would be really cool if we added a feature that allowed freelancers and employers to communicate via messaging.

### Description of my feature

Our CPT project had a variety of features. The feature that I worked on was a review feature. This feature would prompt the user with a review, which upon completion, would send a post request to the backend. The backend would add this new review to the database, and a get request in the frontend would request for the reviews in the database to be displayed under a section named "Recent Reviews."

Below I provide you with a youtube video I created that perfectly encapsulates my feature.

Here is an image of what my feature looks like on the site, alongside an image of the database I made for this reviews feature:

Overall, my opinion on my feature are that it works very well, just could use a bit more front end styling. Other then that I believe this feature is very detailed. My feature does meet college board requirements.

All of thesse requirements were met and our project is set for the AP exam.

### Overall thoughts + errors

Overall I believe the website turned out great, with many cool features. The features took a lot of effort and are really interesting, just the frontend could use some work. I think that this project turned out greate, and checked with the CB requirements to ensure that it matched. Working with teamates and getting advice from classmates and the teachers really helped me in my journy. Brainstorming cool ideas, an error 400, and a cors error were all the biggest challenges. All of these errors interfered with the data transfer, though hours of debugging helped me make my feature flawless.
