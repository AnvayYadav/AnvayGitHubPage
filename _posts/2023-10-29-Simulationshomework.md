##Question 3

A social media platform that I frequently use is Tiktok. Tiktok has a "for you page", which is an aspect of an algorithm used to improve their feature and usability. The "for you page" presents the user with a bunch of short videos that they discover based on their personal preferences(algorithm detects watch time, and what videos they liked.)
