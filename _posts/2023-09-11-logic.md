Game Initialization:
Create a list of words
Select a random word from the list
Set max attempts (e.g., 6)
Initialize guessed letters as an empty list

Display Hangman:
Create ASCII art for each part of the hangman (head, body, left arm, right arm, left leg, right leg)
Create a variable to keep track of the current state of the hangman (e.g., starting with an empty hangman)

Gameplay Loop:
While max attempts > 0:
    
Display the current state of the hangman
Display the word with underscores and filled-in letters based on guessed letters
Display the number of attempts left

    Guess a Letter:
    
Ask the player for a letter guess
Validate the input (single character, not guessed before)

    Check in Word:
    
If the guessed letter is in the word:
Update the displayed word to reveal the guessed letter at the correct positions

    Incorrect Guess Handling:
    
If the guessed letter is not in the word:
Decrement max attempts
Add the corresponding part to the hangman

    Win/Lose Condition:
    
If the displayed word matches the target word:
Display a victory message
Break out of the loop (game over)
If max attempts reach 0:
Display a defeat message
Display the correct word
Break out of the loop (game over)

Game Termination:
Ask the player if they want to play again

const obstacles = document.querySelectorAll('.obstacle');
            obstacles.forEach((obstacle) => {
                let position = parseInt(obstacle.style.top);

                    const playerLeft = player.getBoundingClientRect().left;
                    const obstacleLeft = obstacle.getBoundingClientRect().left;
                    const speed = 5; // Adjust the speed as needed
                    if (obstacleLeft < playerLeft) {
                        obstacle.style.left = obstacleLeft + speed + 'px';
                    } else if (obstacleLeft > playerLeft) {
                        obstacle.style.left = obstacleLeft - speed + 'px';
                    }

                } else {
                    // Reset position at the top and randomize horizontal position
                    obstacle.style.top = '0px';
                    obstacle.style.left = getRandomLeft() + 'px';
                }
            });

            obstacles.forEach((obstacle) => {
                const obstacleRect = obstacle.getBoundingClientRect();
                if (
                    playerRect.left < obstacleRect.left + obstacleRect.width &&
                    playerRect.left + playerRect.width > obstacleRect.left &&
                    playerRect.top < obstacleRect.top + obstacleRect.height &&
                    playerRect.top + playerRect.height > obstacleRect.top
                ) {
