### How has the digital divide been bettered/worsened by recent national or global events? How may the digital divide get worse in the future without intervention?

The digital divide has witnessed both improvements and gotten worse in recent national and global events. The COVID-19 pandemic, for example, has underscored existing inequalities in access to technology. Lockdowns and the increased reliance on remote work and online education disproportionately affected those without reliable internet connections or proper devices that could help them use the online resources like others. However, the pandemic has also spurred initiatives to destroy the gap, with governments and organizations recognizing the urgency of addressing digital inequalities. Efforts such as subsidized internet access, community Wi-Fi projects, and the distribution of devices to underserved communities have been notable steps toward narrowing the digital divide in recent times.
Looking ahead, the digital divide may worsen without intervention, driven by technological advancements and economic imbalance. As technology continues to evolve, those who are unable to keep up may find themselves further marginalized and the gap will increase between those who have digital access and those who donâ€™t. 

### Give some examples of how individuals, organizations, and the government can all help lessen the digital divide.

Economic barriers could prevent certain populations from acquiring the necessary tools and skills to participate fully in the digital age.
To prevent such deepening inequalities, concerted efforts are required. Individuals can contribute by supporting digital literacy programs and advocating for affordable access. Organizations can play a role by investing in community projects and fostering inclusivity in their digital products. Governments, too, can implement policies that prioritize infrastructure development and provide targeted support to underserved areas, ensuring that the benefits of digital knowledge and utility are available for all.
