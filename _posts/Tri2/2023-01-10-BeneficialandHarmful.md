### Bonus Hack(0.05 extra points)
### Self Reflect on your use of technology? Whats your daily screen time? What beneficial effects of technology do you utilize and what are some negative consequences you succcumb to?

My daily screen time is like 6 hours. I use technology to learn new stuff like history and any coding videos. I really like watching informative YouTube videos to learn about stuff. However, most of the time, I scroll for too long and waste my time.


### Homework
### Choose an innovation(Social media, computers, phones, etc.) and talk about an alternative use than what its actually use for. Then, give the potential positive and negative impacts of the use you came up with



An alternative use for the innovation of Social Media could be an education platform.
Positive:
Transforming social media into an education platform could have several positive impacts. It could promote collaboration among students, provide access to educational resources, and create a space for interactive learning. Teachers could use social media to share educational content, conduct virtual classrooms, and engage students in discussions. This alternative use could most likely break down geographical barriers and make quality learning materials accessible to a larger audience.
Negative:
There are also many potential negatives to repurposing social media for education. Privacy concerns would need to be addressed, as educational content often involves personal information. Additionally, the risk of misinformation and the potential for cyberbullying may thrive, impacting the learning environment. There could also be issues related to the digital divide, where students without reliable internet access or proper devices may be left behind.
Here are a few ways that I could minimize unintended risks in programming:
Code Reviews:
Conduct regular code reviews with peers to catch potential issues and ensure that best practices are followed.
Encourage a culture of constructive feedback and continuous improvement within the development team.
Error Handling:
Implement robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle unexpected situations and prevent crashes.
Log errors with sufficient information for debugging and monitoring.
Input Validation:
Security Audits:
Periodically conduct security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
Engage external security experts for penetration testing and third-party code reviews.
Backup and Recovery:
Establish robust backup and recovery mechanisms to mitigate the impact of data loss or system failures.
Regularly test backup and recovery processes to ensure their effectiveness.
