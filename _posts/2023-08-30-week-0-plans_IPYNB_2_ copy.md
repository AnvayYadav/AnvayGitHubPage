My goal by the end of this week is to get a hardworking partner that can help me fix any issues that I have, and overcome and work together for all the assignments and projects that we will have. I also hope to have VS code set up, with the repository installed, all necessary extensions in place, and all things installed. I hope to be in a position where I can start customizing my website my the end of next week.
- Wednesday - During wednesday, we were introduced to our teachers and the system of the class. We were told that we must work with a partner during this course, ensure that we don't use paper during class, and pay attention in the Tech Talks. I picked my pair share partner, mycrossover pair, and establish a team of four. I spent some time talking and getting to know each other, particularly with Computer Science experience and goals. My partner has similar coding experience as me, making him a suitable partner.
- Thursday - On Thursday I signed up on Slack, and was told that this is how I would communicate with my teacher and peers after school hours. I also started to set up the vscode, install the proper extensions, and clone the repository today. Today was a productive day, where I set up a lot of my notebook, however I did occurr some trouble with my Make File, preventing further progress.
- Friday - Today, we continued our setup, as we bundle installed, however there was a roadblock in the road of our progress. This was the make file, which had some error. We started thinking about how we could customize our website, and make it more personalize.
