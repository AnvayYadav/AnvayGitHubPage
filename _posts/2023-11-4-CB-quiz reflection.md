I recieved a 60/66 on my CB quiz.

The questions I missed and the correct explanation for them is provided below:

# Question 6:

Which of the following best describes the role of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) ?

A
Developing standards and protocols for Internet communication
B
Preventing copyrighted materials from being illegally distributed online
C
Preventing malicious software from being distributed online
D
Verifying the ownership of encrypted keys used in secured messages

Correct: 
A
Developing standards and protocols for Internet communication

The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is primarily responsible for developing and maintaining standards and protocols related to Internet communication. Option A accurately describes its role. It does not focus on preventing copyright infringement, dealing with malicious software, or verifying ownership of encrypted keys.

# Question 19:

A library of e-books contains metadata for each book. The metadata are intended to help a search feature find books that users are interested in. Which of the following is LEAST likely to be contained in the metadata of each e-book?

A
An archive containing previous versions of the e-book
B
The author and title of the e-book
C
The date the e-book was first published
D
The genre of the e-book (e.g., comedy, fantasy, romance, etc.)

Correct:
A
An archive containing previous versions of the e-book

In the context of metadata for e-books in a library, having an archive of previous versions of the e-book is the least likely to be contained in the metadata. While information like the author and title (B), the publication date (C), and the genre (D) are typical metadata elements that help users find and identify e-books, maintaining an archive of previous versions of the e-book is not a standard part of metadata but might be stored separately by the library for its own records or version control.

# Question 28:

A text-editing application uses binary sequences to represent each of 200 different characters. What is the minimum number of bits needed to assign a unique bit sequence to each of the possible characters?

A 4
B 6
C 7
D 8

COrrect:

To represent 200 different characters using binary sequences, you would need enough bits to have unique combinations for each character. To calculate the minimum number of bits required, you can use the formula:

N = log2(X)
Where N is the number of bits needed, and X is the number of different characters to be represented.
N = log2(200)
N ≈ 7.64
Since you can't have a fraction of a bit, you would need at least 8 bits to represent 200 different characters.
So, the correct answer is:
D, 8

# Question 42

Internet protocol version 4 (IPv4) represents each IP address as a 32-bit binary number. Internet protocol version 6 (IPv6) represents each IP address as a 128-bit binary number. Which of the following best describes the result of using 128-bit addresses instead of 32-bit addresses?

A
4 times as many addresses are available.
B
96 times as many addresses are available.
C
2 to the fourth power times as many addresses are available.
D
2 raised to the ninety sixth power times as many addresses are available.

Correct:
D
2 raised to the ninety sixth power times as many addresses are available.

IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses, which means there are 2^128 possible unique IP addresses. This is an astronomically larger number compared to the 2^32 addresses available in IPv4. To calculate the increase in the number of available addresses, you can compare the difference in the number of bits used in the two protocols, which is 128 - 32 = 96. So, there are 2^96 times as many addresses available in IPv6 compared to IPv4.

# Question 51

Which of the following is an example of symmetric encryption?

A
Evy buys a locked box that operates using two different codes. When the first code is entered, a slot opens that allows a message to be put in the box. When the second code is entered, the door to the box opens. Evy gives the first code to her friends so they can leave messages for her and keeps the second code to herself so that she is the only one who can retrieve the messages.
B
Finn and Gwen develop a system that maps each letter of the alphabet to a unique symbol using a secret key. Finn uses the key to write a message to Gwen where each letter is replaced with the corresponding symbol. Gwen uses the key to map each symbol back to the original letter.
C
Hannah writes a message to send to Isabel and hides the message under a rock behind the soccer field. Hannah gives Isabel the exact location of the rock so that only Isabel can find the message.
D
Juan writes a message to send to Kelly and slides the message through a slot in the front of Kelly’s locker. Juan knows that Kelly has not shared her locker combination with anyone, so no one other than Kelly will be able to read the message.

Correct:

B
Finn and Gwen develop a system that maps each letter of the alphabet to a unique symbol using a secret key. Finn uses the key to write a message to Gwen where each letter is replaced with the corresponding symbol. Gwen uses the key to map each symbol back to the original letter.

Option B describes symmetric encryption. In this scenario, Finn and Gwen share a secret key to encrypt and decrypt messages. It's a form of symmetric encryption because the same key is used for both encryption and decryption, and it ensures that only those with the key can read the message. This is similar to how symmetric encryption algorithms work in the field of cryptography, where the same key is used for both encryption and decryption of data.

# Question 64:

Directions: For the question or incomplete statement below, two of the suggested answers are correct. For this question, you must select both correct choices to earn credit. No partial credit will be earned if only one correct choice is selected. Select the two that are best in each case.​

Which of the following statements describe how cloud computing has affected Internet communication?

Select two answers.

A
Cloud computing has eliminated the need to provide redundancy in Internet routing.
B
Cloud computing has helped enhance collaboration.
C
Cloud computing has introduced new data-security concerns.
D
Cloud computing has reduced concerns about intellectual property rights.

Correct:

B
Cloud computing has helped enhance collaboration.

C
Cloud computing has introduced new data-security concerns.

Explanation:
A. This statement is not accurate. Cloud computing doesn't eliminate the need for redundancy in Internet routing. Redundancy is still important for ensuring the reliability and availability of Internet communication.

D. This statement is not accurate either. Cloud computing hasn't reduced concerns about intellectual property rights. In fact, it has raised new concerns, particularly related to data ownership and control in the cloud.
