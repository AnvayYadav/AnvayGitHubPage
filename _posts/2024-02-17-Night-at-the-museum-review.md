### Reflection
- We have a good features integrated in our website
- There is potential to add many more features, for example a salary search
- Though our features and idea are good, our frontend could use a lot of work
- Adding a more interactive feature would keep our users engaged and make our website more appealing overall
- The overall experience was very good, gained some insight on what our project is lacking and what we can add in the future

### Ideas/Feedback

- Some  ideas I gained was to add a search based on the salary of the job. I also believe that a geolocation system would be a very cool and interactive idea
- Mr. Lopez's advice for our project is to add a profiling system to our Jobly where employers can see which users applied to their job
- In addition to this, Mr. Lopez suggested that we alert freelancers that have applied if they were accepted for the job. We are going to use this feedback to create a profiling system and make our website more applicable to the real world

### Overall thoughts

I saw many projects at N@TM, including one with an online casion, mario game, meme generator, and a clash royale deck creator. I could tell that people put a lot of effort into these projects. A lot of impressive projects, and we even saw a CSA group with a website with the same idea as our own group. The overall mood and atmosphere of the night was good, and I met and talked to a lot of people about their project and development.
