### Reflection
- We have a good features integrated in our website
- There is potential to add many more features, for example a salary search
- Though our features and idea are good, our frontend could use a lot of work
- Adding a more interactive feature would keep our users engaged and make our website more appealing overall
- The overall experience was very good, gained some insight on what our project is lacking and what we can add in the future

### Ideas/Feedback

- Some  ideas I gained was to add a search based on the salary of the job. I also believe that a geolocation system would be a very cool and interactive idea
- Mr. Lopez's advice for our project is to add a profiling system to our Jobly where employers can see which users applied to their job
- In addition to this, Mr. Lopez suggested that we alert freelancers that have applied if they were accepted for the job. We are going to use this feedback to create a profiling system and make our website more applicable to the real world
