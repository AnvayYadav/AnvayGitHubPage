### PBL Unit 1 / Week 0


Week two has the second Live Review for the trimester, which is also worth 2 points. The expectations in this live review is to have my notebook setup, with hacks, tangibles, and plans. All of these must also be paired with the website being edited so that it's more personalized towards you, with cool additional hacks. On Monday, I finished last week's live review, and began working on this new one, by recloning the repository. This was required, since the teacher repository was edited and must be recloned and edited. After recloning the website, I pasted all my old code into the new repository. On Tuesday and Wednesday, I started duplicating posts and renaming them, so I could fill up each section in the table with posts. It took me some time to figure out how to move the posts, and there was a issue in github that took a few hours of working to fix. On Thursday my partner and I began to add the mandatory hacks, which were the calculator, game of life, and snake game. We also began to add additional hacks like a mini pong game, a tab full of my favorite videos, and tables full of terms that I've learned. Friday was my live review, where we got a 97.5%. There were a few refinements made on Friday, and we began brainstorming on whatt our hacks for next week should be.
