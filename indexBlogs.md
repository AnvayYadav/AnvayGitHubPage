    <td>Week 0</td>
    <td>To briefly summarize everything that was done in Week 0, I'll discuss approximately everything we were expected to complete. We started off the week by learning what the course is about, and some of the fundamentals. These fundamentls include about how we were told to collaborate with a partner, and make sure that we don't do it alone. We also learned additional information about this class, like the fact that we will be studying a Big Idea each week, that GitHub (GH) Pages should be used as a project/lab notebook, and that this class will have PBL Tech Talks and College Board Test Prep. The task for this week was to install VScode, succesfully set up our website and github pages, and make sure everything is running smoothly.</td>

    <td> Week 1 has a two point Live-Review assignment. In this assignment my partner and I will be in a live session with Mr. Mortensen, and show him our websites, github pages, talk about the challenges we faced, and show him certain tools. In this assignment you must upload you're freeform picture that you must sketch online, and write a littl bit about yourself, and customize the website as you please. In order to recieve full credit, you must do everything that is asked, and also do something extra. For extra credit, I have customized my website theme, added more images and videos, built a mini game, and designed the Blog Page.</td>
