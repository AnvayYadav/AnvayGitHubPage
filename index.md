## Anvay's CSP Pagess

I drew this image in freeform to display some of my favorite things, and show my current interests. The following image was drawn virtually, and shows my favorite brand of clothing, the sport I play, the instrument I play, along with my favorite video game and the line "I <3 CS." I've started playing piano ever since I was 8 years old, and have become a very proficient player. Currently I'm playing tennis, and trying my hardest to make JV this year, and Varsity in Junior year. Nike has been my favorite brand for a long time, since I love all the new sho designs that they manafacture, along with the clothing that they have. My favorite video game has been Minecraft ever since childhood, when I played the X-box 360 with my brother. Finally, the last attribute that I've added to this sketch is the line "I <3 CS", since I'm eager to learn new programming languages and become proficient with coding, since my dream is to major in computer science and write all sorts of code.
